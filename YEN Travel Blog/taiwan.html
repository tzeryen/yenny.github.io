  <p>Growing up watching Taiwanese dramas and listening to Taiwanese pop songs, I have an unusual intimate connection with this country. The culture and lifestyle that have been conveyed through the media placed an influence, indirectly, on me as I grew up.<br>
    <br>
    It was a dream come true when I finally took the visit. Taipei has a unique and vibrant nightlife that every tourist will definitely miss. With almost every district in the city filled with night markets and delicious street food, there is always something to look forward to when the city lights are on. Here I will state the TOP 10 THINGS I ENJOYED during my trip to Taipei: 
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1. Shopping at Shi-Da Night Market (師大夜市).</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4786/40115289244_737ffec980_o.jpg" width="660" height="440"><br>
    <br>
    Shi-Da Night Market is, in my opinion, the best night market that has both nice shops to shop in and mouth-watering street food to enjoy! In terms of fashion, Taiwanese are always on trend! You can find the latest fashion trends in almost every corner of the night market sold at reasonable prices. Don't forget to also try the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken (鹽酥雞) at Shi Yun（師園）stall！<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2. Have hotpot at Mala Hot Pot Restaurant (馬辣頂級鴛鴦火鍋)</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/799/25953180757_f4ac6bef44_o.jpg" width="660" height="440"><br>
    <br>
    This restaurant has many branches in Ximending district itself. I ordered a mix of spicy ("Mala") and clear soup base. It offers good quality red meat with great prices, and an all-you-can-eat buffet which includes beer and ice cream. A must-try restaurant when you come to Ximending! <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>3. Enjoy a bowl of mee sua at Ah Zong Mian Xian (阿宗麵線) </strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4780/40824916611_fea0988c8d_o.jpg" width="660" height="440"><br>
    <br>
    Also in Ximending, Ah Zong Mian Xian serves the best mee sua in Taipei! Although there are no places to sit, food enthusiasts like me crowd here to have a bowl of mee sua because it is THAT TASTY! <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>4. Enjoy the city lights view from Taipei 101 Observatory. </strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/809/40115913514_4d70446fd6_o.jpg" width="660" height="440"><br>
    <br>
    I would say, if you are visiting Taipei for the first time, you should go up to the top of this iconic landmark. The lift journey up to Taipei 101 Observatory is a magical experience. What's more, the view of Taipei from up there is breathtaking! <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>5. Takemuri Izakaya 竹村居酒屋 - 'In Time With You' (我可能不會愛你). </strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/787/25953810007_9f4a8147d8_o.jpg" width="660" height="440"><br>
    <br>
    Did I mention I love watching Taiwanese dramas? This Izakaya was the main characters' secret hideouts in my all time favourite drama 我可能不會愛你. Standing in front of it, my heart was screaming in happiness! Enjoy the splendid view of Taipei 101 from here with yakitori and beer. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>6. Enjoy the sunset at Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf (淡水漁人碼頭) </strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4774/39015535780_54534c5d1a_b.jpg" width="660" height="440"><br>
    <br>
    Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf is a half an hour bus ride from Tamsui Old Street (淡水老街), so plan your time well. My suggestion is to spend some time at Tamsui Old Street in the afternoon, rent a bike if you fancy to ride along the Tamsui River, and then head straight to Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf by about 5pm before the sun sets!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>7. Walk along Jiufen Old Street (九份老街). </strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4771/39015741110_c83c05b701_o.jpg" width="660" height="440"><br>
    <br>
    This is the famous Ah Mei Tea House (阿妹茶樓) which has inspired the Miyazaki film - Spirited Away. Stroll through the unique old street and try its famous delights, including the Ah Gan Yi taro balls (阿柑姨芋圆), grilled mushrooms and dorayaki with ice cream. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>8. Pingxi(平溪), Shifen(十分), Jingtong(菁桐) and Sky Lantern. </strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/813/26956386308_7e1d476827_o.jpg" width="660" height="440"><br>
    <br>
    Take the Pingxi Line train from Ruifang station (瑞芳火车站) to visit Pingxi, Shifen and Jingtong respectively. Each place has its own unique village, and many visitors come here to experience lighting up sky lanterns. Write your wishes, release these lanterns up to the sky, and hopfully your dreams will come true! <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>9. Have Hot Spring Eggs (溫泉蛋) at Xinbeitou (新北投). </strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/806/26956660428_c3f7250320_o.jpg" width="660" height="440"><br>
    <br>
    There are many attractions in Xinbeitou including the Beitou Park (北投公園), Taipei Public Library (臺北市立圖書館) and Thermal Valley (地熱谷). Before you head to the Thermal Valley, remember to try the hot spring eggs at Man-lai Ramen Restaurant (满来温泉拉面). You can tell how delicious it is by just looking at the picture! <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>10. Enjoy a bowl of Lu Rou Fan (滷肉飯) at Tian Tian Li (天天利美食坊）. </strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4783/39931849375_f1a20e6e32_o.jpg" width="660" height="440"><br>
    <br>
    This was the BEST lu rou fan I have tried throughout my trip in Taipei. Located in Ximending, Tian Tian Li sells a variety of Taiwanese delicacies including this delicious braised pork rice, oyster omelette and turnip cakes. Add a fried egg to your lu rou fan and enjoy a wonderful breakfast. <br>
